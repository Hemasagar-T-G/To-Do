### To-Do Application

A full-stack To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, providing a seamless user experience for managing daily tasks.

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing tasks.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle API requests and routing.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend server.

## Tools Used
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for data modeling.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design and styling the user interface.
- **Nodemon**: Tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected.
- **dotenv**: Module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, used for managing configuration.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Persistent data storage with MongoDB

### Prerequisites
